#Dominance Factor Bookmarklet
A bookmarklet which calculates your League of Legends dominance factor based on your last 10 games

##About the Bookmarklet
This [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) displays a summoner's [dominance factor](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kill_to_Death_Ratio) (DF) based on the information [LolKing](http://www.lolking.net/) provides on their last 10 games. DF is an alternative to kill to death ratio (KDR) for scoring a player's contribution to the game. Using this method, kills count as 2 points, deaths count as -3 points, and assists count as 1 point.

This bookmarklet only takes into account ranked and unranked 5v5s - co-op vs. AI, custom games, dominion, and all other game modes are not included in the calculation.

2. Set the name as "LoL Dominance Factor" (or anything else you desire).
3. Paste the code from bookmarklet.js into the URL field.
4. Save the bookmark.
